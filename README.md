This project focuses on creating a tool that converts videos into images. Users can upload a video, which is then split into individual frames. Docker is used to package the tool to ensure consistent functionality across different environments. Flask is employed to handle video uploads, and ffmpeg is used for video processing. We used Minikube to set up a local Kubernetes cluster for testing purposes. The tool is deployed using Kubernetes and Knative, which facilitate management and scaling. We tested the tool by uploading videos through a web interface and verifying that the frames were correctly extracted. This project demonstrates how to build, package, deploy, and manage a tool using modern technologies for efficient video-to-image conversion.
